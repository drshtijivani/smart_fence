The Smart Fence project is an IoT-based agricultural protection system that utilizes advanced 
sensor technology and responsive deterrent mechanisms to detect and deter animal intrusion 
along farm boundaries. A key innovation is the integration of a customized frequency generator 
module, emitting frequencies targeted to specific animal threats, enhancing the system's ability 
to mitigate damage. By combining visual, auditory, and mist-based deterrents, the project offers 
a comprehensive defence against wildlife intrusion, promoting sustainable agriculture practices 
and safeguarding farmers' livelihoods across diverse agricultural landscapes.

Implementation :
At its core, the system operates on the principles of real-time monitoring and proactive response. 
Surveillance cameras strategically positioned across the farm continuously monitor the premises, 
capturing any movement or activity. Integrated motion sensors detect the presence of animals, 
triggering immediate alerts to notify farmers of potential threats.

The inclusion of ultrasonic sound generators adds an extra layer of deterrence, emitting high
frequency sounds that are unpleasant to animals, effectively discouraging them from entering the 
farm premises. Additionally, access control mechanisms, such as remote-controlled gates or barriers, 
further enhance security by restricting unauthorized entry.

Crucially, the system leverages IoT technology to enable remote monitoring and management. 
Farmers can access the system through a user-friendly interface, allowing them to view live camera 
feeds, receive real-time alerts, and remotely control security measures from anywhere, at any time.
 
By providing actionable insights and timely alerts, the IoT-Based Farm Surveillance System empowers 
farmers to take swift preventive action, minimizing the risk of crop damage and ensuring the 
continued productivity and profitability of their farms. It represents a vital tool in modern agriculture, 
offering comprehensive security coverage and peace of mind to farmers facing the persistent 
challenge of protecting their hard-earned harvests.
